			<p style="color: darkolivegreen; font-size:20px; min-height: 10vh;">Taking the time to help people not only makes them happy, but it also makes you happy. Helping other people gives you a surge of oxytocin, serotonin, and <a href="../page8/index.html"> dopamine</a>, all of which create good feelings. In a Harvard study, employees who helped others were 10 times more likely to be focused at work and 40% more likely to get a promotion. The same study showed that people who consistently provided social support were the most likely to be happy during times of high stress. As long as you make certain that you arenâ€™t overcommitting yourself, helping others is sure to have a positive influence on your mood
