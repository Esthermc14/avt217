		<h1 style="color: yellow;"> HABIT #4 GET ENOUGH SLEEP!</h1>
			<p style="color: darkolivegreen; font-size:20px;"> When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, removing toxic proteins that accumulate during the day as byproducts of normal neuronal activity. This ensures that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your energy, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough quality sleep. <a href="../page5/index.html">Sleep </a> deprivation also raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Happy people make sleep a priority, because it makes them feel great and they know how lousy they feel when they’re sleep deprived.</p>
