		<h1> Habit #5: SURROUND YOURSELF WITH QUALITY PEOPLE</h1>
			<p> Happiness spreads through people. Surrounding yourself with happy people builds confidence, stimulates creativity, and it’s flat-out fun. Hanging around negative people has the opposite effect. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about <a href="../page6/index.html"> themselves.</a> Think of it this way: If a person were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You’d distance yourself, and you should do the same with negative people.</p>
